# **Mindlab App Test**

A lightweight custom Shopify app built with **Express (Node.js)** and **React**, designed to authenticate a merchant with the **Mindlab API**, retrieve their available AI agents, allow selection of one agent, and finally embed a **UMD Chat Widget** into the Shopify storefront.

This project was developed as a technical test and demonstrates:

* Shopify app installation flow
* Secure backend authentication with Mindlab
* Serving a dynamic widget loader through a Shopify ScriptTag / theme snippet
* Rendering a fully integrated AI chat widget inside the storefront
* Frontend UI for selecting AI agents

## **3. Features Overview**

### ✅ **Mindlab Authentication**

Authenticate the Shopify merchant with Mindlab via:

```
POST /api/v1/auth/signin
```

---

### ✅ **AI Agent Management**

**Get agents:**

```
GET /api/v1/mindlab/agents/:companyId
```

**Select active agent:**

### ✅ **Dynamic UMD Widget Loader for Shopify Storefront**

The widget is rendered through this dynamically generated script:

```
GET /api/v1/mindlab/widget/widget.js
```

The script:

* Loads React + ReactDOM (UMD)
* Loads the ChatWidget UMD bundle
* Injects required CSS
* Calls:

  ```js
  ChatWidget.init("mindlab-widget-root", widgetConfig);
  ```

This is embedded in Shopify through a theme snippet:

```liquid
<div id="mindlab-widget-root"></div>
<script src="https://DOMAIN/api/v1/mindlab/widget/widget.js" async></script>
```
